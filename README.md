# Intellivoid Issues

A public repository used for reporting issues such as bug reports, feature
requests and so on, developers & maintainers will respond directly to
opened issues and close the issue if it has been resolved.


## Why a GitHub repository?

In some cases, this will be easier to track & organize issues with
Intellivoid, additionally this could provide public transparency and act
as resources for others who are experincing the same or similar issue.


## What type of issues should i report?

It can be anything within reason, for example the following may be OK

 - Bugs with Software/Services (Including API wrappers)
 - Improvement requests, such as a typo that needs to be corrected or
   how our services should be improved
 - Feature requests, request additional features that we could add or
   remove, no gurantees that we will actually go through with your request
   but gives us an idea of what our users want to see in our products.
 - Software questions, eg; how does ... work


## What are the files used for in this repository?

We may add or remove files to this repository such as images or documents
as a way to reference large responses or notices.
